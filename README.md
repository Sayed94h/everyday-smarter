# Everyday Smarter

This is the repository of my portfolio or my own website.

I collected my projects and coding experience in one page on this [web page](https://everydaysmarter.herokuapp.com/projects.html).

I hope that you find enough information about me on the web page.

I am looking to find a job as a web developer(frontend, backend or full stack developer).
